# Data Documentation: Synthetic Patient Records for Financial Toxicity Analysis

## Overview

This project uses entirely synthetic patient data generated by **Synthea™**, an open-source patient population simulator developed by MITRE Corporation. No real patient information is used in this analysis. All records are computationally generated to be structurally realistic while containing no protected health information.

Synthea data is released with **no cost and no restrictions**. It is explicitly designed for research, education, and software testing purposes where real patient data would be inappropriate or unavailable.

## Dataset Characteristics

**Population Simulated:** Kentucky, United States  
**Total Patients:** 1,701 synthetic individuals  
**Date Range:** Multi-year simulated patient lifespans (Synthea generates complete medical histories from birth)  
**Cohort for Financial Analysis:** 186 patients (10.9%) with billed claims in the dataset

### Why Only 10.9% Have Claims Data

Synthea generates patients across full lifespans, many of whom may not have had recent billable healthcare encounters at the time the dataset was extracted. This is realistic: not everyone in a population seeks medical care within a given year. For this analysis, we focus on the subset of patients who have billing records, which is the clinically and financially relevant cohort.

## Data Tables and Structure

The analysis integrates five primary tables following a relational database structure common in healthcare systems:

**1. Patients Table** (`patients.csv`)  
Contains demographic and socioeconomic information for each synthetic individual. Key fields include:
- Patient ID (unique identifier)
- Birth date and age
- Gender
- Race and ethnicity
- Income (annual, simulated based on demographic profiles)
- Geographic location (city, county, zip code)

**2. Claims Table** (`claims.csv`)  
Records individual claims submitted for reimbursement. Each row represents a billable encounter. Key fields include:
- Claim ID (unique identifier)
- Patient ID (links to patients table)
- Service date and billing date
- Total amount billed
- Outstanding patient balance (`OUTSTANDINGP`)
- Claim status (`STATUSP`): Billed, Paid, or other

**3. Claims Transactions Table** (`claims_transactions.csv`)  
Tracks individual payment transactions associated with claims, including both payer payments and patient payments. Key fields include:
- Transaction ID
- Claim ID (links to claims table)
- Transfer type: "1" indicates payer paid, "p" indicates patient paid
- Unit amount (dollar value of the transaction)
- Transaction date

**4. Payers Table** (`payers.csv`)  
Contains information about insurance companies and coverage types. Key fields include:
- Payer ID (unique identifier)
- Payer name (e.g., "Blue Cross Blue Shield", "Medicare", "NO_INSURANCE" for self-pay)
- Payer type (private, government, self-pay)

**5. Conditions Table** (`conditions.csv`)  
Records diagnosed medical conditions using standardized medical codes. Key fields include:
- Patient ID
- Condition code (SNOMED-CT or ICD-10 codes)
- Start date and end date
- Condition description

## Data Processing Pipeline

The analysis aggregates these raw tables to create patient-level features suitable for predictive modeling. The Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process follows these steps:

**Step 1: Condition Aggregation**  
We count the number of unique diagnosed conditions per patient, creating a `comorbidity_count` feature. This serves as a proxy for clinical complexity. Patients with more diagnoses typically require more intensive and expensive care.

**Step 2: Financial Aggregation**  
We sum all claim transactions at the patient level to calculate:
- Total amount billed (sum of all claim amounts)
- Total outstanding patient balance (what the patient still owes)
- Total payer paid (sum of all insurance payments)
- Total patient paid (sum of all out-of-pocket payments)

**Step 3: Payment Ratio Calculation**  
For each patient, we calculate what percentage of their total bill has been paid (either by insurance or out-of-pocket). This payment ratio becomes our key outcome variable.

**Step 4: High-Risk Label Construction**  
We define "high-risk" patients as those meeting both criteria:
- Payment ratio below 80% (meaning they have paid less than 80% of what they owe)
- Outstanding balance exceeding $100 (to exclude trivially small amounts)

This definition is a modeling choice designed to identify patients with meaningful payment struggles. In real-world deployment, hospitals would calibrate this threshold based on their specific bad debt patterns and financial assistance policies.

## Important Limitations of Synthetic Data

While Synthea generates structurally realistic health records, it has important limitations for financial toxicity research:

**1. Simplified Payment Behavior**  
Synthea does not model realistic payment behavior or financial decision-making. In this dataset, 78.2% of patients with bills have a perfect 100% payment ratio, which is unrealistic compared to empirical medical debt data showing tens of millions of Americans carrying unpaid medical bills.

**2. Weak Income-Payment Correlation**  
Income in Synthea is generated based on demographic distributions but is not meaningfully correlated with payment behavior, since payment behavior itself is not realistically modeled. This explains why income shows minimal predictive power in our analysis despite being a known driver of medical debt in real populations.

**3. No Behavioral Realism**  
Real patients make complex decisions about which bills to pay, when to negotiate payment plans, and when to seek financial assistance. Synthea does not simulate these dynamics. The financial data reflects billing amounts and insurance reimbursement logic, but not actual patient financial circumstances or choices.

These limitations mean our model demonstrates *methodological feasibility* but not *deployment-ready prediction*. The analytical pipeline and feature engineering approach would transfer to real claims data, but model performance would need to be re-evaluated on actual payment histories.

## Reproducing the Dataset

If you want to generate your own Synthea dataset or modify the population parameters:

**Option 1: Use the Provided Dataset**  
The synthetic patient files used in this analysis are included in the `data/` directory of this repository. This is the simplest approach for reproducing the exact analysis presented.

**Option 2: Generate Fresh Synthea Data**  
To create a new synthetic population:

1. Download Synthea from [github.com/synthetichealth/synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea)
2. Follow Synthea's installation instructions (requires Java)
3. Generate a Kentucky population:
   ```bash
   ./run_synthea -p 1701 Kentucky
   ```
4. The output CSV files will be created in the `output/csv/` directory
5. Replace the files in `data/kentucky/` with your newly generated files

**Option 3: Generate Data for a Different Region**  
Synthea supports all U.S. states and can generate customized population demographics. See Synthea documentation for details on customizing population parameters, disease prevalence, and healthcare utilization patterns.

## Data Privacy and Ethics

**This project contains no real patient data.** All analysis was conducted on synthetic records specifically designed for research and education. No institutional review board (IRB) approval was required because no human subjects were involved.

If you adapt this methodology to real electronic health record or claims data, you must:
- Obtain appropriate IRB approval or institutional data use agreements
- Ensure all data is properly de-identified per HIPAA Safe Harbor or Expert Determination standards
- Implement appropriate security controls for protected health information
- Consider algorithmic fairness and potential bias in risk scoring systems deployed for financial decisions

Financial risk models used in healthcare settings can have significant equity implications. Models trained on real data should be evaluated for disparate impact across demographic groups and calibrated to avoid reinforcing existing disparities in access to financial assistance.

## Questions or Issues
